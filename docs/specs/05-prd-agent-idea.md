Great. Before starting the build of the current project, I need your help to write out a comprehensive implementation plan. Assume that the engineers have zero context for our codebase and questionable taste. document everything they need to know. which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check. how to test it.give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. frequent commits. Assume they are skilled developers, but know almost nothing about our toolset or problem domain. assume they don't know good test design very well. please write out this plan, in full detail, into docs/plans/
